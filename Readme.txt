Wei Ding, Zhang Tao, Yao He, Jiawei Wang, Lijie Wu, Pu Han, Chaode Zheng, Yuanxin Gu, Lingxiao Zeng, Quan Hao and Haifu Fan (2018). Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, P.R. China (available at http://cryst.iphy.ac.cn/Download/IPCAS/STABLE/) 

This is the full package of IPCAS 2.0 with OASIS4.2 included. The package consists of
       5 directories: "bin", "ccp4i", "src", and "user_guide";
       3 files: INSTALL  ipcas_install.tcsh  and readme (this file).

The script ipcas_install.tcsh should be run within the directory that contains subdirectories "bin", "ccp4i", "src" . It put all necessary IPCAS files into CCP4 working directories. Notice that, in some cases ipcas_install.tcsh may be failed to run without administrator privilege.

"bin" contains IPCAS executable/script files.

"ccp4i" contains files needed for running IPCAS within CCP4i.

"src" contains OASIS4.2 and related source codes.

"user_guide" contains tutorial and example data files.
